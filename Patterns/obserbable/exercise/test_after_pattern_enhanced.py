# The code remains clean while providing enhanced monitoring

# Sending a POST request (Normal response)
data = {"title": "foo", "body": "bar", "userId": 1}
session.post("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts", json=data)

# Sending a request to a non-existent URL (Triggers error handling)
# This demonstrates the error handling capabilities
session.get("https://notexisturlinallinternet.com")

# Simulating a slow request using a delayed API endpoint
# This demonstrates the performance monitoring capabilities
session.get("https://httpbin.org/delay/3")  # Should trigger slow request warning

# ADVANCED BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH:
# 1. All basic Observer pattern benefits (separation of concerns, reusability)
# 2. Enhanced error handling - centralized and consistent
# 3. Performance monitoring capabilities
# 4. Configurable behavior (e.g., slow_threshold)
# 5. The code can handle edge cases without disrupting the main functionality
# 6. Can be further extended with additional monitoring capabilities
